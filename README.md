# Humana-Mays-Case-Competition
The project contains how my teammates and I build a machine learning model to predict which members are likely to be hesitant to get COVID vaccination, and provide recommendation and potential solutions to drive vaccination among the sub-segments of hesitant members based on the insights derived from the data.
## Files and Descriptions
1. _2021CaseCompetition_Yichao_Liu_20211010.pdf_: A complete summary of data manipulation, modeling process, and business insights we gain from the dataset.
2. _Code.ipynb_: The Python code of the classification model.
### Results
The model achieves an AUC of 0.674, which ranked top 5% among all competition teams.
