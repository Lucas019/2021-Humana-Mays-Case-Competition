# Humana-Mays-Case-Competition
The project contains how my teammates and I build a machine learning model to predict which members are likely to be hesitant to get COVID vaccination, and provide recommendation and potential solutions to drive vaccination among the sub-segments of hesitant members based on the insights derived from the data.
## Files and Descriptions
